- **Proper Sudoku Rules**: Validates row, column, and 3x3 subgrid constraints
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Watch the algorithm solve puzzles step by step
- **Real-time Validation**: Invalid moves are highlighted immediately
- **Animated Solving**: Visual feedback during the solving process
- **Puzzle Generation**: Generate random solvable puzzles
- **Visual Highlighting**: Shows related cells when focused
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys to navigate the grid
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick access to main functions

## How to Use

### Basic Controls

1. **Enter Numbers**: Click on any cell and type a number (1-9)
2. **Navigate**: Use arrow keys to move between cells
3. **Solve**: Click "Solve Puzzle" to watch the algorithm work
4. **Clear**: Click "Clear Grid" to start over
5. **Generate**: Click "Generate Puzzle" for a new challenge

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl + Enter`: Solve the current puzzle
- `Ctrl + Backspace`: Clear the grid
- `Ctrl + G`: Generate a new puzzle
- `Arrow Keys`: Navigate between cells
- `Backspace/Delete`: Clear current cell

## Sudoku Rules

Standard Sudoku rules apply:

1. **Grid**: 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 subgrids
2. **Numbers**: Use digits 1-9 only
3. **Row Rule**: Each row must contain all digits 1-9 exactly once
4. **Column Rule**: Each column must contain all digits 1-9 exactly once  
5. **Box Rule**: Each 3x3 subgrid must contain all digits 1-9 exactly once

## Algorithm

The solver uses a **backtracking algorithm** which:

1. Finds the first empty cell (scanning left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
2. Tries numbers 1-9 in that cell
3. Checks if the number is valid according to Sudoku rules:
   - No duplicates in the same row
   - No duplicates in the same column
   - No duplicates in the same 3x3 subgrid
4. If valid, moves to the next empty cell
5. If no valid number exists, backtracks to the previous cell
6. Repeats until the puzzle is solved or proven unsolvable

## Technical Implementation
